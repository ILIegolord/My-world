# Going from Bad to Better: From Internet Voting to Blockchain Voting

MIT said no to Blockchain voting, but I am sure there is potential in the unknown. There might not be a perfect solution for online voting, but let's see how far I get.

## Reasons why MIT is wrong
1. They didn't even try. Just saying fundamental security problems will occure, since it has always been like that with electronic voting systems, is a false claim.
2. Yes, paper-ballot-based voting is the best so far, but again there will be progress and eventually be a solution available!
3. The Election is a huge victim of attacks and online are new potentials for these, but what if we can erase them all one day? Being stuck on precinct voting is just convenient.
